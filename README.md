### What Is Music Therapy?

Music Therapy is the study and practice of how music affects people. It does not promote or require musical ability, but instead is a process of making, being affected by, and responding to music to address specific, desired outcomes.

__Music therapy is a discipline in which Certified Music Therapists (MTAs) use music purposefully within therapeutic relationships to support development, health, and well-being. Music therapists use music safely and ethically to address human needs within cognitive, communicative, emotional, musical, physical, social, and spiritual domains.__ – Canadian Association of Music Therapists

# <h2 id="link2">Project Background</h2>

A survey was conducted to assess the impact of music on people's mental health and mood in general. The survey recorded responses from over 700 participants and includes details like musical preferences, listening habits, and overall state of mind. Respondents were given 16 genres of music for which they ranked the frequency of listening to each. The responses ranged from never, to very frequently.

Moreover, the respondents also ranked the intensity of their feelings of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD on a scale of 1 to 10. 0 being the lowest in intensity to 10 being the highest.
